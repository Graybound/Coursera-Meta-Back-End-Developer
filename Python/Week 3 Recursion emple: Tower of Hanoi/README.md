# Tower of Hanoi practice solution

## This is just practice and still needs a lot of work such as getting it to work properly and removing unused code made while experimenting & learning.

The main file is [towerOfHanoi.py](towerOfHanoi.py). There are the 3 files ([HanoiTower.py](HanoiTower.py) & [HanoiTowerIterative.py](HanoiTowerIterative.py) & [MetaCourseSolution.py](MetaCourseSolution.py))that work and are not original. They use the known mathematical solution to solve recursively which makes for much shorter and cleaner code. I do not want to cheat so I want to eventually figure out my own algorithm and learn how to optimize it later.

The [test.py](test.py) is not important and just used so that I can test different functions in python and learn how they work and see if/how I could use them.
